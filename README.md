Hi,
In this project I implemented a React/Redux and Typescript web app that receives the name of a user in a form and displays the most likely Gender and Nationality of this user. As more user names are submitted the new results shown while keeping the older results as well. used Redux to save the state.
to run the project do the following orders:
1. go to server root folder with command line and run 'npm i && npm run dev'
2. go to client root folder with command line and run 'npm i && npm run dev' 
3. open the browser on localhost:3000
4. that's all.
If you have feedbacks, suggestions I'll glad to hear.
Thanks, Getaneh.
